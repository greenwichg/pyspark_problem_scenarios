# CVS Health Drug Loss Analysis — SQL Interview Question

A leading pharmacy chain, CVS Health, wants to analyze its financial performance by identifying losses incurred on drugs, each of which is exclusively produced by a specific manufacturer.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Write a SQL query to:

1. Identify manufacturers whose drugs have caused a financial loss (i.e., `COGS > total_sales`).
2. For each such manufacturer, calculate:
    - The number of loss-making drugs (`drug_count`)
    - The total monetary loss (`total_loss`) as an absolute value
3. Sort the result in descending order of `total_loss`, with the manufacturer having the highest loss listed first.

## 📌 Example

### ✅ Input: `dls_drug_loss`

| product_id | units_sold | total_sales | cogs       | manufacturer | drug                        |
|------------|------------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 156        | 895143     | 3130097.00  | 3427421.73 | Biogen       | Acyclovir                  |
| 25         | 222331     | 2753546.00  | 2974975.36 | AbbVie       | Lamivudine and Zidovudine  |
| 50         | 90484      | 2521023.73  | 2742445.90 | Eli Lilly    | Dermasorb TA Complete Kit  |
| 98         | 110746     | 813188.82   | 140422.87  | Biogen       | Medi-Chord                 |

### ✅ Expected Output

| manufacturer | drug_count | total_loss |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Biogen       | 1          | 297324.73  |
| AbbVie       | 1          | 221429.36  |
| Eli Lilly    | 1          | 221422.17  |

## 🔍 Explanation

- A loss is recorded when `cogs > total_sales`.
- For example:
    - Biogen's drug Acyclovir caused a loss of `3427421.73 - 3130097.00 = 297324.73`.
    - AbbVie's drug Lamivudine and Zidovudine had a loss of `2974975.36 - 2753546.00 = 221429.36`.
- Profitable drugs, like Medi-Chord from Biogen (where `cogs < total_sales`), are excluded.
- Results are ordered by the largest total loss first.

## ✅ Output Requirements

Return a result with the following columns:

- `manufacturer`: Name of the manufacturer
- `drug_count`: Number of loss-making drugs
- `total_loss`: Sum of all losses for that manufacturer (as absolute values)
